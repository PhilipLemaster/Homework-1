# This is my first homework assignment submission.
The code given for this website was modified in both the HTML and CSS files associated.
I first made an effort to look through the entirity of the code to familiarize myself with
the layout of the website and it's components.
I condensed many redundancies within the code, such as duplicate edits for different tags and unnecessary
labels and edits.
I then updated the semantics to make more sense and accurately reflect their design and purpose within the site.
I more logically organized the CSS styles to parallel that of the HTML code and added notes so future developers
could more easily make changes.
I fixed the routing of the link for 'Search Engine Optimization', as this link did not work properly beforehand.
I added a concise title for the website and alternative IDs for images to enhance accessibilty.

# This was a fun assignment that tested and honed my ability to identify how code can be condensed
# and updated to enhance readabity, accessibility, and long-term sustainability.
